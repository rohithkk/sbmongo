SpringBoot Mongo App


### MongoDB changes so I won't forget again
1. Installed MongoDB using homebrew, by default, the databases were supposed to be
stored at the location /usr/local/var/mongodb/. But I changed the location to /Users/rohith/workspace/mongodb-data. This setting is in  /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
2. If needed, check the mongodb logs at /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/
3. The mongo binaries are here: /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb
